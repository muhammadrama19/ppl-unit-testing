## How to Run Tests and View Allure Reports

### Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed on your system:
- We use Java 21. For more you can download it here [Java Official Website](https://www.java.com/)
- Apache Maven 3.9.9 you can download it here [Maven Official Website](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadrama19/ppl-unit-testing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd ppl-unit-testing
   ```

3. **Clean Up the target folder in case it cached during next test:**
   This command will clean all target folder.
   ```bash
   mvn clean
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**
   This command will execute the JUnit 5 tests.
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

5. **Generate the Allure Report**
   After running the tests, generate the Allure HTML report:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:report
   ```

6. **Open the Report Manually**
   After the report is generated, open the following file in a browser:
   ```
   target/site/allure-maven-plugin/index.html
   ```

   - **If you're using Visual Studio Code**, right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"** as shown below:

7. **Alternative: Serve the Report Automatically**
   Use this command to open the report in your default browser automatically. Note that this method does **not** create a physical `index.html` file:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:serve
   ```
